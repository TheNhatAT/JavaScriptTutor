6 primitives data types:
    + undefined
    + Boolean
    + Number:
        - +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN ("Not a Number").
        - numbers between -(2^53 − 1) and 2^53 − 1
    + String
        - immutable
    + BigInt
    + Symbol
        - unique, immutable
    + null
    -> use typeof instance === 'data_types'
Structural types:
    + Object: use new keyword
    + Function
Data property:
    + [[value]]
    + [[Writable]]
    + [[Enumerable]] - use in for..in loop
    + [[Configurable]]
    + [[Set]] and [[Get]]
Indexed collections:
    + Arrays:
    + Typed Array:
        - For raw data (represent by bit)
        - buffer -> ArrayBuffer: an object representing a chunk of data
        - view -> DataView: provides a getter/setter API to read and write arbitrary data to the buffer
Keyed collections:
    + Maps
    + Sets
    + WeakMaps
    + WeakSets


Note:
    + Falsy value: like false in Boolean
        - false, 0, -0, 0n, '', "", null, undefined, NaN.
