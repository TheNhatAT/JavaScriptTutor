* The async keyword:
    - make a function into async function which can return promise object
* The await keyword:
    - work inside async function
    - can use await when calling any function that returns a Promise
    -> use to pause the code until the promise fulfills
    -> make JS runtime to pause the code on the line which it's used until the async function return its result

==> Can add async in front of class/object methods make them return promises, and await promises inside them
