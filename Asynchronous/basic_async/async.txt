Note:
    - blocking: the code run and the browser be frozen
    - there are two main types of async code style in JS:
        + old-style callback
        + newer promise-style
    - promise is object representing the completion or failure of the async operation
    - event queue: run after the main thread has finishes processing (callback queue - event loop)
    - can't guarantee that the async function will return before the browser has processed the sync block.
    - the functions allow code run asynchronously after certain time:
        + setTimeout() -> MIN time to run
        + setInterval() -> MIN time to wait
        + requestAnimationFrame() -> new version of setInterval() for animation
